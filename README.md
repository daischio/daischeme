# Description
Daischeme is a code generation library for JSON manipulation in statically typed languages. It uses JSON-schema for creating source code. It also can extract JSON-schema from a json file.

# Objectives
- Create a Go binary for doing all the process.
- Export a native library to make it usable in other languages also.
